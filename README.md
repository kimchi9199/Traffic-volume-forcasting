# Traffic volume forcasting
The increase of means of transport, on the one hand,
makes traveling easy and convenient, and unintentionally makes
traffic congestion more and more serious, especially in big cities.
Traffic congestion has a direct and indirect impact on a country’s
economy and its dwellers’ health. Traffic congestion effects on
individual level as well. Time loss, especially during peak hours,
mental stress, and the added pollution to the global warming are
also some important factors caused due to traffic congestion. In
recent years, traffic volume prediction has received lots of interest
from researchers. However, there are still many challenges that
needs to be resolved. Models for traffic volume prediction needs
not only to be accurate but also be able to handle the huge
volume of input traffic data. This study present an implement of a
traffic volume forecasting system using distributed deep learning.
A state of the art deep learning model, that is LSTM, is used
to provide accurate forecasting result. Especially, the model is
trained in a distributed manner using BigDL library. Thank to
the distributed training, the model now is able to receive a huge
volume of traffic data to provide the most accurate results
